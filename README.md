In this application, students will have student accounts, and teaching assistants will have TA accounts. As a student, you type in your “workshop code” provided by your instructor in order to access a virtual workshop (algebra workshop, statistics workshop, etc). In the virtual workshop, you are able to select the specific course you are hoping to find help in (eg. MACM101, STAT 270, etc). Upon searching for a course, you are able to choose an assignment from that course of which other students are currently/were previously working on. 

At this point, several videos appear on the screen for the user to click, along with a “live assistance” button at the bottom. The videos are of other students being helped on the same assignment on specific questions by a TA in case a question has already been answered. Otherwise, the user can click the live assistance button to notify a TA in order for them to help. This will enable the user and TA to turn on their camera and their microphone in order to communicate better. The user may pick a specific TA depending on their preference. After the TA has helped, the recording of the assistance section is quickly submitted for others to see. Students will also be able to see TAs help other students live and pitch in their own questions.

As a teaching assistant, you will be able to set yourself as “active” on multiple workshops. If you would like to make yourself available for assistance in a statistics workshop and discrete mathematics workshop, you may. You will also be able to pick which courses specifically you will be able to provide assistance for. 

Objectives – We want to provide students an experience as similar as possible to a real university workshop, only virtual. Learners who used workshops in their faculties are struggling to find alternative methods of studying with the social effects of COVID-19 limiting their workshop usage. Though there are ways to collaborate with peers online and communicate with TAs, these methods are simply too slow and unintuitive. We plan to fix this with Workshop+.

Results –  Students will be able to get help from those who they know can certainly can answer their questions. TAs will also be far more productive in helping others, and because of the saved videos feature, will be able to avoid helping many students with the same question. Productivity will be boosted phenomenally.
